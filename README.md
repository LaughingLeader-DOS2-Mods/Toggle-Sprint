Toggle Sprint Mod for Divinity: Original Sin 2
=======
Toggle Sprint adds the ability to toggle a faster movement status outside of combat. Sprinting can also be set to automatically turn back on once combat ends.

To get the auto-sprint "toggle ball", check your inventory after toggling
sprint. If, for some reason, you don't have sprint on a new game, reload
a save and it should be added to all your player characters.

Current sprint speed values are set at what feels like a reasonable pace. More
options for tweaking speed values may be available in the future, upon
request.
